Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire \[1992\] 1 AC 310

NEGLIGENCE – PSYCHIATRIC DAMAGE – TRAUMATIC EVENT WITNESSED INDIRECTLY – DISTINCTION BETWEEN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY VICTIMS

### Facts

A joined action was brought by Alcock (C) and several other claimants against the head of the South Yorkshire Police. C and the other claimants all had relatives who were caught up in the Hillsborough Stadium disaster, in which 95 fans of Liverpool FC died in a crush due, it was later established, to the negligence of the police in permitting too many supporters to crowd in one part of the stadium. The disaster was broadcast on live television, where several claimants alleged they had witnessed friends and relatives die. Others were present in the stadium or had heard about the events in other ways. All claimed damages for the psychiatric harm they suffered as a result.

### Issue

The House of Lords were called upon to determine whether, for the purposes of establishing liability in negligence, those who suffer purely psychiatric harm from witnessing an event at which they are not physically present are sufficiently proximate for a duty to be owed, and thus can be said to be reasonably within the contemplation of the tortfeasor.

### Decision/Outcome

The House of Lords, in finding for D, held that, in cases of purely psychiatric damage caused by negligence, a distinction must be drawn between ‘primary’ and ‘secondary’ victims. A primary victim was one who was present at the event as a participant, and would thus be owed a duty-of-care by D, subject to harm caused being foreseeable, of course. A secondary victim, by contrast, would only succeed if they fell within certain criteria. Such persons must establish:

* A close tie of love and affection to a primary victim  
* Appreciation of the event with their own unaided senses  
* Proximity to the event or its immediate aftermath  
* The psychiatric harm must be caused by a sufficiently shocking event.

Neither C nor the other claimants could meet these conditions, therefore the appeal was dismissed.

## **Lord Ackner**

5 propositions were laid down

1. Psychiatric illnesses caused not by shock, such as by the experience of losing a loved one, attracts no damages  
2. Damages for psychiatric shock from merely being informed of, or reading, or hearing about the accident are not recoverable  
3. Mere mental suffering, although reasonably foreseeable, if unaccompanied by psychiatric injury, is not recoverable  
4. There is yet no authority that a negligent person or his estate is liable for psychiatric shock sustained as a result of self-inflicted injury or death by the negligent person  
5. “Shock,” involves the sudden appreciation by sight or sound of a horrifying event, which violently agitates the mind. Psychiatric illness caused gradually is not recoverable

Lord Wilberforce’s 3 elements must be applied

1. Class of persons who claim should be recognised  
   * There must be the closest of family ties with the victim  
   * There is a rebuttable presumption that love and affection in relationships between husband and wife and parent and child is such that it ought to be reasonably foreseeable that persons in those relationships are likely to suffer shock resulting in psychiatric illness  
   * An unconnected bystander cannot be entirely excluded if it is particularly horrific  
2. Proximity to the accident  
   * It is reasonably foreseeable that injury by shock can be caused to a plaintiff, not only through the sight or hearing of the event, but of its immediate aftermath.  
3. Means of shock  
   * It must come through sight or hearing of the event or of its immediate aftermath  
   * Law should not compensate shock brought by communication of a third party  
   * Watching the accident on TV does not suffice  
     * Where there is no certainty that your loved one is injured, watching the television only causes anxiety, shock comes later when the news confirme  
     * \*However, if a hot air balloon burst into flames with children inside playing in real time on TV, the organisers are liable

Dealing with the cases

* The two parties who were at the site  
  * There was no evidence of particularly close ties of love or affection  
  * Hence, they were not foreseeably at risk of injury  
* Relatives that saw the incident through TV  
  * They were not within ‘sight or hearing of the event or of its immediate aftermath’  
  * The broadcast did not depict suffering of recognisable individuals
