SECTION 6 REMOTENESS OF DAMAGE

20.6.1 Like duty of care, the rules on remoteness of damage effectively place an artificial limit on the number of negligence actions which can succeed. For consideration of the need to limit potentially indeterminate liability, see, eg, *Ho Soo Fong v Standard Chartered Bank \[2007\] 2 SLR (R) 181; \[2007\] SGCA 4* (Standard Chartered; see Section 20.6.6 below). The role of remoteness is to filter out situations where – even assuming that duty, breach and causation can all be satisfactorily established – the nature of the damage sustained makes it unfair to make the defendant liable.

*A. Type of damage must be reasonably foreseeable*

*(1) Old approach to remoteness: defendant liable for damage directly resulting from negligence*

20.6.2 Under the old approach to remoteness, a defendant was liable for any damage which resulted directly from his negligence, no matter how unusual or unpredictable that damage might be. However, in the Wagon Mound \[1961\] AC 388 the Privy Council replaced the direct consequence test with the requirement that, in order to be recoverable, damage must be of a type which is foreseeable in all the circumstances, and this is approach is now universally favoured: *Fong Maun Yee and Another v Yoong Weng Ho Robert \[1997\] 1 SLR (R) 751*.

*(2) New approach to remoteness: defendant liable for type of damage foreseeable in all circumstances*

20.6.3 The *Wagon Mound* test is generally accepted as being less claimant-friendly than the direct consequence test. In order to ameliorate its harshness, the courts when deciding whether damage is of a foreseeable type normally take a relatively liberal view, holding that neither the manner nor the extent of the damage is relevant to the determination. Although some courts have on occasion adopted a more restrictive approach, the decision of the House of Lords in Jolley v Sutton London Borough Council \[2000\] 1 WLR 1082, suggests that the liberal approach is to be preferred. For a novel application of the Wagon Mound test in Singapore, see the decision in Man Mohan Singh (see Section 20.3.6 above), where it was held not only that there was no duty of care with respect to IVF treatment following the deaths of the claimants’ only children in a car accident, but also that such treatment did not constitute damage of a foreseeable type.

*The Egg-shell Skull Rule*

20.6.4 In all tort actions, a defendant must take his victim as he finds him. Under the egg-shell skull rule, which applies to personal injuries, this concept is adapted to allow recovery even for unforeseeable damage. The egg-shell skull rule applies in circumstances where, due to a claimant’s innate physical susceptibility to illness or injury, he suffers extreme and unforeseeable damage which is triggered by the initially foreseeable damage caused by the defendant’s negligence: Smith v Leech Brain & Co Ltd \[1962\] 2 QB 405\. When applied with respect to damage of an unforeseeable type (as opposed to merely an unforeseeable extent) the egg-shell skull rule operates as an exception to the Wagon Mound test.

*B. The egg-shell skull rule: allowing recovery for unforeseeable damage*

20.6.5 Under English law, where the claimant has an ‘egg-shell personality’ and the damage complained of is psychological rather than physical, he need not even show that the initial injury is of a foreseeable type, as long as some injury was foreseeable in the circumstances: Page (see Section 20.3.5 above). However, Page has been the subject of considerable criticism, and was rejected by the Singapore Court of Appeal in Ngiam (see Section 20.3.5 above).

20.6.6 Under variants of the egg-shell skull rule, claimants may also seek compensation for unforeseeable property damage (*Low Siew Keng v Seng Huat Construction Pte Ltd \[1998\] SGHC 197*) and for unforeseeable additional damage sustained due to extreme impecuniosity ( Standard Chartered, see Section 20.6.1 above).

SECTION 7 DEFENCES TO NEGLIGENCE

20.7.1 All the standard tort law defences are available in actions for negligence, but in the vast majority of cases the most relevant defences are illegality, volenti non fit injuria and – most importantly – contributory negligence. For discussion of all three defences, see *Rashid Osman bin Abdul Razak v Abdul Muhaimanin bin Khairuddin and another \[2013\] SGHC 49*.

*A. Illegality: where a claimant is himself a wrongdoer*

*(1) Illegality may also be considered at the duty stage or when determining appropriate standard of care*

20.7.2 Where a claimant is himself a wrongdoer, his action may be defeated on the grounds of his illegality. Illegality is sometimes considered at the duty stage, particularly in Australia: Miller v Miller \[2011\] HCA 9, and has in the past also been regarded as relevant to determining the appropriate standard of care: Pitts v Hunt \[1991\] QB 24\. In the UK, cases involving joint illegal enterprises – the main circumstance in which illegality is pleaded – are now determined by reference to principles of causation: Joyce v O’Brien & Anor \[2013\] EWCA Civ 546\. However, notwithstanding the various stages at which illegality is considered, it continues to be described in common parlance as a ‘defence’.

*(2) Defence normally succeeds only in cases where the claimant's conduct was criminal in nature*

20.7.3 In theory, illegality (also known as ex turpi causa non oritur actio) extends to both illegal and immoral acts, although in United Project Consultants Pte Ltd (see Section 20.3.13 above), the Singapore Court of Appeal stressed that a plea of illegality would normally succeed only in cases where the claimant’s conduct was criminal in nature. Since illegality provides a complete defence to a defendant who is himself, by definition, a wrongdoer, the courts take a cautious approach when holding that it is applicable. Although the majority of cases in which illegality is pleaded successfully involve joint illegal enterprises, in the UK illegality has also defeated claims in cases of discrete wrongs where the claimant has committed a serious criminal offence (such as taking a life) : see, eg, Clunis v Camden and Islington Health Authority \[1998\] QB 978 and Gray v Thames Trains \[2009\] UKHL 33; \[2009\] 3 WLR 167\. In Singapore, the possibility of illegality being pleaded outside joint illegal enterprise cases has also been recognized in United Project Consultants (see Section 20.3.13 above).

*(3) Defence will not succeed where wrong is insufficiently connected with claimant’s damage, or where damage defendant causes is disproportionate to the claimant’s wrong*

20.7.4 Where the claimant’s wrong is insufficiently connected with his damage, or where the damage which the defendant causes is disproportionate to the claimant’s wrong, an illegality plea is unlikely to succeed. In the latter situation, however, the defence of contributory negligence may be applicable: Revill v Newbery \[1996\].

*B. Consent: where claimant either expressly or implicitly accepts the risk of harm associated with a defendant’s conduct*

*(1) Consent is a full defence pleaded successfully only in extreme situations*

20.7.5 Where a claimant either expressly or implicitly accepts the risk of harm associated with a defendant’s conduct, his claim may be defeated by the defence of volenti non fit injuria. However, since, like illegality, volenti is a full defence, the courts are generally unwilling to allow it to defeat a claim: *Administrators of the Estate of Tan Ah Hock (deceased) v Low Beng Hai and another \[1994\] SGHC 88* (Estate of Tan Ah Hock, see Section 20.7.13 below), and it is pleaded successfully only in extreme situations.

*(2) Claimant must be shown to have had full knowledge and understanding of the risk involved and freely agreed to assume the very risk that materialized*

20.7.6 For the defence to succeed, it must be shown that the claimant had full knowledge and understanding of the risk involved, that he freely agreed to assume that risk, and that the risk to which he consented was the one which materialized. Only rarely does the defence succeed in cases involving employees: ICI v Shatwell \[1965\] AC 656, and for policy reasons it is never available in actions brought by rescuers.

*(3) Defence outlawed by legislation in cases of road traffic accidents*

20.7.7 Where road traffic accidents are concerned, the defence has been outlawed by legislation: see the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap.189 2000 Rev Ed). It may be pleaded in claims involving other types of vehicles (such as light aircraft), but it succeeds only in cases where the risks are substantial and the claimant’s conduct has been particularly cavalier: Morris v Murray \[1991\] 2 QB 6\.

*(4) Consent and risks assumed when participating in sporting activities*

20.7.8 Volenti may be relevant to the risks assumed when participating in sporting activities, although in relation to risks faced by spectators a better approach is probably to treat the situation as one in which a lower standard of care is applicable: Wooldridge v Sumner \[1963\] 2 QB 43 (see Section 20.4.5 above). For the interplay between duty of care and volenti in determining the liability of regulators and referees to participants in sports, see, eg, Watson v British Boxing Board of Control \[2001\] QB 1134 and Vowles v Evans & The Welsh Rugby Union Ltd \[2003\] 1 WLR 1607\.

*(5) Unfair Contract Terms Act applies in a business context where defendant seeks to exclude liability for negligence by express agreement or by notice*

20.7.9 In a business context, a defendant who seeks to exclude liability for negligence by an express agreement or by notice is subject to the provisions of the Unfair Contract Terms Act (Cap 396, 1994 Rev Ed). Under section 2(1) it is impossible to exclude liability for death or personal injury attributable to negligence, and under section 2(2) purported exclusion of liability for negligence in other situations must pass the test of reasonableness.

*C. Contributory negligence: where claimant suffers damage as a result partly of his own fault and partly of the fault of another or others*

*(1) Partial defence where damages are reduced to reflect claimant’s share of responsibility for harm sustained.*

20.7.10 Historically, contributory negligence was a complete defence, but under the Contributory Negligence and Personal Injuries Act (Cap 54, 2002 Rev Ed) a claimant who suffers damage as a result partly of his own fault and partly of the fault of another or others no longer has his claim defeated. Instead, his damages are reduced to reflect his share of the responsibility for the harm which he has sustained.

*(2) Contributory negligence established where claimant fails to take reasonable care of himself according to the standards of the reasonable person*

20.7.11 The standard of care is objective, so a claimant will be contributorily negligent if he fails to take reasonable care of himself according to the standards of the reasonable person. However, as with actions in the tort of negligence proper, lower standards of care apply in some situations, and less is expected in terms of self-preservation on the part of child claimants: Gough v Thorne \[1966\] 1 WLR 1387 and by claimants faced with situations of emergency: Jones v Boyce (1816) 1 Stark 493\. Where a claimant has not himself been negligent, his damages will not normally be reduced merely because others have failed to take adequate care of him. One exception is where the claimant is an employer suing a defendant for damage caused to his property at a time when that property was in the care and control of his employee. In such circumstances, damages will be reduced to reflect any contributory negligence on the part of the employee.

*(3) Claimant’s negligence results in reduction of damages only where it is causally relevant to the damage sustained*

20.7.12 A claimant’s negligence will result in a reduction of damages only where it is causally relevant to the damage he has sustained. Where his negligence contributes to the accident itself (as where he crosses a road without using a pedestrian crossing) his damages may be reduced substantially: *Ng Weng Cheong v Soh Oh Loo & Anor \[1993\] 1 SLR (R) 532*. But where his negligence contributes only to the extent of his damage (as where he merely fails to wear a seat belt or crash helmet) the reduction in damages is normally small: *Froom v Butcher* \[1976\] QB 286\. As these cases indicate, contributory negligence is commonly pleaded in road accident cases, and particularly cases where pedestrians are injured by drivers: see, eg, Jackson v Murray \[2015\] UKSC 5\. For an interesting recent example of such a case, see *Asnah Bte Ab Rahman v Li Jianlin \[2016\] SGCA 16*, where – in a rare split decision – the Court of Appeal (Chief Justice Suresh Menon dissenting) held a pedestrian 15% to blame for an accident in which he was hit by a taxi when crossing a road with the green man symbol in his favour.

*(4) Damages reduced by one half where the claimant and the defendant are equally to blame*

20.7.13 In situations where the claimant and the defendant are equally to blame, the claimant’s damages are reduced by one half: *Administrators of the Estate of Tan Ah Hock* (see Section 20.7.5 above). This is also the case where there are multiple defendants, and the claimant’s fault is equal to that of the defendants: Fitzgerald v Lane \[1988\] 3 WLR 365\. It is generally (although not universally) accepted that it would be ‘logically unsupportable’ to reduce damages by 100% under the Contributory Negligence Act: see, eg, the decision of the Court of Appeal in Pitts v Hunt \[1991\] QB 24\.
