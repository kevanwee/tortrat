SECTION 5 CAUSATION OF DAMAGE

*A. Causation: the physical link between the defendant’s negligence and the claimant’s damage*

20.5.1 Causation relates to the physical link between the defendant’s negligence and the claimant’s damage. Even if it can be shown both that the defendant breached his duty of care to the claimant and that the claimant sustained damage, the claim will not succeed unless the damage is shown to have resulted from the breach. For a detailed analysis of the rules on causation as applied in Singapore (albeit with little discussion of recent developments elsewhere), see the decision of the Court of Appeal in Sunny Metal (Sections 20.2.12 and 20.3.13 above and 20.5.2 below).

*Simple Issues of Causation*

*B. The ‘but-for’ test: dealing with simple issues of causation*

20.5.2 The basic test for establishing causation is the ‘but-for’ test, under which the defendant will be liable only if the claimant’s damage would not have occurred but for his negligence – or, looked at the other way round, the defendant will not be liable if the damage would, or could, have happened anyway, regardless of his negligence: *Yeo Peng Hock v Pai Lily \[2001\] 3 SLR (R) 555*. (In Sunny Metal (Sections 20.2.12, 20.3.13 and 20.5.1 above) the Court of Appeal held that the but-for test could also be extended to determine the issue of causation in fact in contract cases).

*C. Multiple consecutive causes: involvement of either a second tortfeasor or a natural event*

20.5.3 The ‘but-for’ test works well in straightforward situations where it is easy to establish that the damage has been caused by the defendant's negligent act: see dicta in *F v Chan Tanny \[2003\] 4 SLR (R) 231*, but it proves inadequate in establishing causation in more complex situations where a number of actual or potential causes operate either consecutively or concurrently.

*Multiple Consecutive Causes*

20.5.4 When there are two discrete torts, one following the other, but no additional damage is caused by the second tort, only the first tortfeasor is liable. Where additional damage is caused by the second tort, each tortfeasor is liable for the damage he has caused. The first tortfeasor’s liability remains what it would have been had the second tort not occurred, even if the physical manifestations of the second tort appear to wipe out the damage caused by the first tort: Baker v Willoughby \[1970\] AC 467 (Baker). This avoids the claimant being under-compensated or the second tortfeasor compensating for more harm than he has actually caused. (Note that in *Salcon Ltd v United Cement Pte Ltd \[2004\] 4 SLR(R) 353*, the Court of Appeal held that – even assuming Baker to be applicable in Singapore – it must be confined to personal injuries, and cannot extend to commercial disputes).

20.5.5 However, when a tort is followed by a natural event which wipes out the physical effects of the tort, the tortfeasor’s liability ceases at the date when the supervening condition manifests itself: Jobling v Associated Dairies \[1982\] AC 794\. If this were not so, the defendant would be liable for damage which would have occurred naturally anyway due to the ‘vicissitudes of life.’

*D. Multiple potential causes: claimant can succeed only if he proves on the balance of probabilities that the damage is attributable to the tort*

20.5.6 Where there are several discrete potential causes of harm, some of which are tortious and some of which are natural, the basic rule is that the claimant can succeed only if he proves on the balance of probabilities that the damage is attributable to the tortious conduct: Wilsher v Essex Area Health Authority \[1988\] AC 1074 (Wilsher).

20.5.7 In circumstances where a defendant has exclusive control over a damage-causing agent, he may be held liable even if his negligence cannot be shown to be the sole cause of the damage, as long as it can be proved to have made a material contribution: Bonnington Castings v Wardlaw \[1956\] AC 613 (Wardlaw). The Wardlaw principle was extended in McGhee v National Coal Board \[1973\] 1 WLR 1 (McGhee) to provide for liability even where a claimant can establish only that the defendant negligently increased the risk of harm. Although McGhee was implicitly criticised in Wilsher (see Section 20.5.6 above), its fortunes were revived in Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd \[2003\] 1 AC 32 (Fairchild), where it was held that several defendants who consecutively exposed claimants to the same risk (of mesothelioma), involving the same damage-causing agent (asbestos fibres), could all be treated as having materially contributed to the disease, and could thus be held jointly liable, even though it was impossible to determine which of them was actually responsible for triggering the condition. The subsequent decision in Barker v Corus UK Ltd \[2006\] 2 WLR 1027 re-interpreted Fairchild as having been based on increased risk, and favoured apportioned liability, but the effect of this decision was reversed by legislation which reinstated joint liability, at least in mesothelioma cases. The application of Fairchild to all mesothelioma cases – even those where exposure to the damage-causing agent is both tortious and environmental – was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Sienkiewicz v Greif (UK) Limited \[2011\] UKSC 10\. However, as the judgments in Zurich Insurance PLC UK Branch v International Energy Group Limited \[2015\] UKSC 33 demonstrate, departure from the ‘but-for’ test in the UK under Fairchild and its satellite cases has given rise to some judicial disquiet. (Fairchild has yet to be accepted as good law in Australia, and in Amaca v Booth \[2011\] HAC 53 the High Court of Australia accepted evidence that mesothelioma could in fact develop as a result of cumulative exposure to asbestos fibres, rather than being triggered at a single moment.)

20.5.8 Note that while the Wardlaw, McGhee and Fairchild principles were developed in the context of industrial diseases contracted through exposure to dangerous dusts and fibres, several decisions in recent years have applied the principles in other circumstances – and most notably in medical negligence situations. For an application of McGhee in Singapore with respect to a hospital’s liability for negligent failure to monitor a post-operative patient, see *Surender Singh s/o Jagdish Singh and another v Li Man Kay \[2010\] 1 SLR 428; \[2009\] SGHC 168\.* and for an application of Wardlaw (in the wake of McGhee and, in particular, Fairchild) in the UK with respect to a hospital’s liability for a patient’s brain damage, see Bailey v Ministry of Defence \[2008\] EWCA Civ 883; \[2009\] 1 WLR 1052\.

*Loss of a Chance*

20.5.9 The standard requirement that in civil actions a claimant must establish his case on the balance of probabilities applies equally to actions based on loss of a chance. Under English law, if there is a less than 51% chance that the thing which might have happened would actually have happened had it not been for the defendant’s negligence, the claimant will fail, even if he seeks to recover not for the whole of his damage but only for the chance which the defendant caused him to lose. This analysis has been applied primarily in medical cases, where actions by claimants whose chances of recovery from illness or injury have been reduced due to the negligence of their doctors have failed when they could not establish that, with proper treatment, their chances of recovery would have exceeded 50%: Gregg v Scott \[2005\] UKHL 2; \[2005\] 2 WLR 268\. Although in the past claims for loss of chance succeeded in medical negligence cases in some Australian states (see, eg, Rufo v Hosking \[2004\] NSWCA 391), the decision of the High Court of Australia in Tabet v Gett \[2010\] HCA 12 established that Australian law does not recognise the concept of loss of chance in medical negligence proceedings.

20.5.10 The rule that a claimant cannot normally recover for a lost chance is modified in cases where a defendant negligently deprives the claimant of the opportunity to gain financial benefit or to avoid financial risk. In such cases, damages are assessed not on the outcome which the claimant would have sought, but on the economic opportunity which he has lost. The claimant must prove on the balance of probabilities that he would have taken action to obtain the relevant benefit or avoid the relevant risk. Once this has been established, he need then only show that the chance which he has lost was real or substantial: *Asia Hotel Investments Ltd v Starwood Asia Pacific Management Pte Ltd & Anor \[2005\] 1 SLR (R) 661* (which, although a contract case, made reference to, and for the most part approved, the test applied in the tort decision of Allied Maples Group Ltd v Simmons & Simmons \[1995\] 1 WLR 1002).

*F. Loss of a right: recovery possible if it can be shown that defendant’s failure to advise claimant of risks inherent in treatment has deprived him of the right to choose a more experienced doctor or defer treatment*

20.5.11 Founded on the notion of patient autonomy, medical negligence cases from both Australia and the UK suggest tacit recognition of a more rights-based approach to damage. Under this approach, a claimant who cannot establish causation using the traditional rules may nevertheless recover if he can show that in failing to advise him of the risks inherent in treatment a defendant has deprived him of the right either to choose a more experienced doctor: Chappel v Hart \[1998\] 195 CLR 232 or to defer the date of the treatment: Chester (see Section 20.4.11 above). However, the concept of patient autonomy has yet to find favour in Singapore: see the judgment of Ang J in Tong Seok May Joanne v Yau Hok Mun Gordon \[2012\] SGHC 252\.

*G. Breaking the chain of causation*

20.5.12 A defendant is potentially liable for all the foreseeable consequences of his negligence. However, the chain of causation between the defendant’s negligence and the damage ultimately sustained by the claimant will be broken by a new intervening act (or *novus actus interveniens*), whether by the claimant himself or by a third party: *Jet Holding Ltd v Cooper Cameron (Singapore) Pte Ltd \[2006\] 3 SLR (R) 769*. To break the chain of causation, the act must be something ultroneous which disturbs the sequence of events.

*(1) Defendant not liable for damage subsequently sustained by claimant’s own unreasonable response*

20.5.13 A defendant who has already negligently caused damage to a claimant, or who has negligently exposed a claimant to the risk of damage, will not be liable for any damage which the claimant subsequently sustains due to his own unreasonable response to the situation in which the defendant has placed him: McKew v Holland & Hannen & Cubitts (Scotland) Ltd \[1969\] 3 All ER 1621\. English courts have refused to make a finding that the claimant has acted unreasonably in a number of situations (including that where a claimant commits suicide following injuries sustained at work: Corr v IBC Vehicles \[2008\] UKHL 13). Where the claimant’s response is not sufficiently unreasonable to break the chain of causation, the defendant will remain liable: Andrea De Cruz (see Sections 20.2.10 and 20.3.18 above). However, if pleaded, the defence of contributory negligence may apply to reduce damages in such circumstances: Sayers v Harlow DC \[1958\] 1 WLR 623\.

20.5.14 Where a defendant has created a situation of danger which requires the claimant to take immediate averting action, the defendant will be liable even if, in the ‘agony of the moment,’ the claimant makes the wrong decision and suffers damage which could have been avoided had he acted differently.

20.5.15 Where the claimant’s act is the very thing against which the defendant is required to offer protection, the defendant will be liable for the consequences of his negligence, however objectively unreasonable the claimant’s act may be, although damages may be reduced to take account of the claimant’s contributory negligence: Reeves v Metropolitan Police Commissioner \[2000\] 1 AC 360\.

*(2) A new intervening act by a third party normally breaks chain of causation between the defendant’s negligence and the claimant’s damage*

20.5.16 A new intervening act by a third party will normally break the chain of causation between the defendant’s negligence and the claimant’s damage. However, an act will not be regarded as ‘new’ if it is sufficiently connected with damage which has already resulted from the defendant’s negligence – eg, a subsequent accident after a road has been blocked due to the defendant’s negligence: Rouse v Squires \[1973\] QB 889, or medical negligence in the treatment of an injury caused by the defendant’s negligence: Webb v Barclays Bank plc and Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust \[2001\] EWCA Civ 1141\. In such circumstances, the defendant may be held partly responsible for the subsequent damage, and the chain of causation will not be broken (although the subsequent tortfeasor will also be partly – and possibly even primarily – liable). Where the defendant has control over a third party, or where the third party is faced with a dilemma created by the defendant, the chain of causation is unlikely to be broken and the defendant will normally be liable to the claimant for the damage caused: Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co Ltd \[1970\] AC 1004\.

*(3) Liability imposed if defendant’s negligence makes it very likely that the third party will cause damage to the claimant*

20.5.17 In other situations, a defendant will not be liable merely because his negligence makes damage to the claimant by a third party foreseeable. Liability will be imposed only if the defendant’s negligence makes it very likely that the third party will cause damage to the claimant: Lamb v Camden LBC \[1981\] QB 625\.
