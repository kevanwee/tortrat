# **Duty of Care (Special type of harm \- psychiatric harm):**

1. ## **General rule (Recognisable Psych Illness \+ Spandeck)**

* In the present case, \[plaintiff\] may want to bring an action against \[defendant\] for negligently causing psychiatric harm. Following *Ngiam Kong Seng v Lim Chiew Hock*, the following four elements need to be satisfied for \[plaintiff\] to succeed in his claim:  
1)  psychiatric harm was a recognised psychiatric illness  
2)  the psychiatric harm was factually foreseeable  
3)  the parties were sufficiently proximate  
4)  there are no policy reasons to negate the prima facie duty of care.

* The framework in Spandeck applies to all cases of negligence, including cases of psychiatric harm. Notwithstanding that, the extent of damage ensuing from psychiatric harm is "open-ended" unlike physical injury which is limited in immediate space and time. As such, the legal control mechanisms for claims for psychiatric harm should be more stringent compared to that for physical injury, hence the additional requirement of the psychiatric harm being a recognised psychiatric illness in *Ngiam*. I will now expound on each of these elements in turn.

2. ## **Recognised psychiatric illness (cognisable)**

* To mount a claim in negligence, the psychiatric harm suffered by the \[plaintiff\] has to be a cognisable one per Ngiam Kong Seng. Further, in Man Mohan Singh, the court held that the plaintiffs could not claim for grief and sorrow of the loss of their children, as these are merely vicissitudes of life and not a recognisable psychiatric illness. On the facts, the psychiatric harm is \<whatever illness stated in the question\>. This is cognisable/not-cognisable because… *(The question of whether a recognisable psychiatric illness exists would normally be decided by the court based on expert psychiatric evidence adduced at trial)*   
* *Ngiam Kong Seng: plaintiff suffered from major depression and suicidal tendencies, resulting from the feeling of being “betrayed”. Court said this injury was not a recognisable psychiatric illness.*  
* *ACB v Thomson Medical: loss of autonomy is not a cognisable injury. Loss of “genetic affinity” is.*

3. ##  **The psychiatric harm was factually foreseeable**

* *Refer to general argument on FF first*  
* Note: the issue relating to the requirement for sudden shock might require legislative attention  
* As per Spandeck, the psychiatric harm has to be factually foreseeable.   
* In Ngiam Kong Seng, the court found the psychiatric damage resulting from the mere communication of bad news to be not factually foreseeable. Currently, it is foreseeable that a person of normal susceptibility would suffer psychiatric harm as \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (tortfeasor’s act was incredulous, immense danger exposed to the plaintiff)  
    
* \[High susceptibility \- but controversial\] \[Plaintiff\]’s medical condition of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ heightens his susceptibility to psychiatric harm. However, it is unclear if this will be taken into account. If the requirement of “normal fortitude” is accepted, persons of extraordinary sensitivity to psychiatric harm who would suffer such harm in circumstances where a normal or ordinary person would not, are not entitled to recover damages unless the Df had knowledge or such risk. This might be unfair to the claimant. It would be a matter of doctrinal incoherence to take into account extraordinary susceptibilities. Hence, in the absence of judicial pronouncement, it is submitted this should still be an objective test, such that it would only be satisfied if a person with normal susceptibility would foreseeably suffer from psychiatric harm upon the defendant’s actions.

4. ##  **The parties were sufficiently proximate**

* (Directly involved) In Ngiam Kong Seng, the primary victim/secondary victim distinction in Page v Smith is no longer relevant. However, in cases when it is a victim that is personally involved in the accident, the McLoughlin factors are almost always satisfied.  
* (“Pure” Psychiatric Harm, i.e. the old “secondary victim”) The Spandeck two-stage test, which explicitly referred to claims for economic loss and physical damage, was applied in Ngiam Kong Seng to determine the existence of a duty of care for psychiatric harm. In addition to factual foreseeability, Deane J's characterisation of circumstantial, physical and causal proximity was applied in Ngiam Kong Seng to correspond with the three proximities in McLoughlin:  
1) closeness of relationship (circumstantial proximity);   
2) proximity of claimant to the accident in space and time (physical proximity);   
3) means by which the shock is caused (causal proximity)

1) **Class of persons**  
* Following Mcloughlin v O’Brian, the court held that “The closer the tie, the greater the claim for consideration”. If the plaintiff a victim are in a: (a) Parent-child; or (b) Husband-wife Relationship, this requirement is satisfied

| Relationship falls under (a) or (b)  | Relationship is not (a) or (b) |
| :---- | :---- |
| Currently, the relationship between \<injured party\> and \<innocent party\> is \<either (a) or (b)\>. Therefore, circumstantial proximity is present  | Although the relationship between \<injured party\> and \<innocent party\> is not one of the above, the courts will fundamentally look at how close the two of them are. Currently, it is likely that the relationship is sufficiently close as \_\_\_\_\_\_ (great trust, close for years.....). Therefore, the relationship shared by the two is similar to the relationships mentioned in Mcloughlin. Hence, circumstantial proximity is present. |

  \[Parties are strangers to each other or distant relatives\]

* In Alcock, the court was not prepared to automatically exclude the cases of bystanders or remote relatives claiming for psychiatric harm. In this case, the court opined that a bystander may be able to claim when the “horrific event would probably be traumatic for even the most phlegmatic spectator”. Currently, although \<guilty party\> and \<innocent party\> are \[strangers/distant relatives\], \<guilty party\>’s act was extremely horrific as \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (blow it out of proportion) Therefore, proximity is nonetheless present.

2) **Proximity to the event or the immediate aftermath**  
* In Ngiam Kong Seng, the court held that the plaintiff must be within direct sight and hearing or present at the immediate aftermath of the accident.  
* First, physical proximity to the accident in time must be present.

| Too far apart | Not far apart |
| :---- | :---- |
| Following Alcock, as the secondary victim perceived the incident 8 to 9 hours after the incident it occurred, the court held that proximity was absent  | Following Mcloughlin, the plaintiff perceived the victims only after two hours after the accident. However, spatial proximity was satisfied as the victims were in the same condition as they were in the accident itself; covered in oil, grime and suffering in pain.Similarly, \<innocent party\> perceived the incident \_\_\_\_\_ after it occurred. Given that this shortly after the incident actually occurred, physical proximity to the accident in time is present  |

* Second, physical proximity to the accident in space must be present  
     
* (Innocent party present at the scene itself) Currently, given that \<innocent party\> was present at the accident site, physical proximity in space is present. Hence, physical proximity is established  
* (Innocent party not at the scene itself) In Mcloughlin, physical proximity includes “aftermath” doctrine. As long as there is close proximity soon after the accident, there will be closeness in both time and space so long as the innocent party is able to experience the aftermath of the accident.

| Proximity Present | Proximity Absent |
| :---- | :---- |
| In McLoughlin, the aftermath of the accident, with the oil and blood on the primary victims were seen by the secondary victim, therefore, this proximity was fulfilled.  OR In Pang Koi Fat v Lim Djoe Phing, mother was physically proximate to her daughter since she witnessed her daughter’s suffering; slow burn for an extended period of time while being right next to her. Additionally, it was not expected that the family  members would be present at the operation nor be aware as to whether a specific operation was carried out negligently or otherwise.  Similarly, given that \<innocent party\> could see the physical consequences of the incident, this would establish spatial proximity Nonetheless, the concept of “immediate aftermath” is a contextual one. As seen from case law, it is largely dependent on whether the court construes the event occasioned by the defendant’s negligence and the plaintiff’s subsequent witnessing of the state of the victim as a single continuous and uninterrupted event, or as a series of distinct events. The court’s decision in this area is largely dependent on its perceptions of fairness and justice.  For instance, in cases where the defendant’s negligence does not occur as a “single momentous event” leading to the “instantaneous deterioration” of the victim’s condition, courts have taken a less rigid approach and construed the entire process as a single uninterrupted event, with the result that the event is equated with being in the immediate aftermath of the defendant’s negligence. One clear example would be medical negligence cases as in the case of Pang Koi Fa – where the plaintiff is unable to witness the defendant’s administration of negligent treatment (such as a botched operation or diagnosis), and where the effects of the defendant’s negligence manifest over a sustained duration of time.   | In Alcock v CC, it was held that a claimant who watches a normal television programme which displays events as they happen does not satisfy the test of proximity. Similarly, \<innocent party\> was unable to witness the “aftermath” of the incident as he was too far removed from the accident, and did not witness the consequences of the incident. However, under the Spandeck approach, it would be artificial to find a lack of proximity merely because it was seen through the TV, especially where technology has advanced considerably since Alcock. Therefore, it is submitted that the issue with this rule is that it disregards the essence of the problem, which is that the plaintiff had witnessed the victim’s injury and as a result, sustained psychiatric harm. Perception through the television should not dilute the essence, which is that of emotional turpitude and upset. In fact, given technological advancements, witnessing the injury through a broadcasting medium would be even more traumatic due to the plaintiff given an unobstructed and a clear view. Hence \[this case is exceptional and proximity is present\]  |

Therefore, physical proximity is present

3) **Means by which the shock is caused**  
* This inquiry is about the manner of experience, the means by which the shock was caused. A fear for personal safety, for the safety of children or for one’s fellow employee have been held to satisfy this requirement. Following McLoughlin, to establish perceptual proximity, the shock must come through sight or hearing of the event or of its immediate aftermath.   
* (Breaking bad news) Additionally, Ngiam Kong Seng states that there is no legal duty to break bad news gently. In the absence of malign intention, no actions can be taken against the bearer of bad news, unless a professional relationship existed between the parties.  
    
* (Immediate) In McLoughlin, the secondary victim, the plaintiff saw the aftermath of the accident as her family members were in various states of injury and were dirty and grimy. Similarly, given that \<innocent party\> was able to view the grotesque consequences of the act, he would naturally have received shock through sight or hearing of the events aftermath  
    
* (Slow burn realisation) Following Pang Koi Fat v Lim Djoe Phing, the court held that the 3rd proximity factor was met as the plaintiff’s shock arose from the sudden and horrifying realisation she experienced.This is because the defendant’s negligence had “put the plaintiff in a position of being morbidly preoccupied with the thought that he or she had been responsible for the injury resulting to the primary victim” The court held that whilst the plaintiff was not immediately aware that the defendant had been negligent in his diagnosis and in his performance of the operation, she was witnessing throughout the effects of these and the subsequent negligent acts of the defendant.  
* Similarly, due to \<guilty party\>’s act, \<innocent party\> became morbidly preoccupied with the effects of the negligent act.  
* This response is something a reasonable person in the plaintiff’s position would experience. Similar to the plaintiff in Pang Koi Fa, by witnessing \_\_\_\_\_\_ (all the horrible events, surgery, post operative surgery...), a reasonable person in \<innocent party\>’s shoes would similarly experience such a profound shock.

* (-ve) (NO sighting at all) In Man Mohan Singh v Zurich Insurance, perceptional proximity was not made out as the plaintiffs had not seen their sons suffering in pain before they died, nor had they seen their bodies in their badly-injured state. 

* \[Conclusion\]  
* Hence, causal proximity is (not) established. Therefore, proximity is (not) present
