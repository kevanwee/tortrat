# **Intentional Torts (Non-trespass):** 

## **The rule in Wilkinson v Downton**

In American law it's called “Intentional infliction of emotional distress”  
Illustration: Practical joke/ prank but somehow was overboard and got out of hand

1. ### **Can damages be sought under the rule in Wilkinson v Downton?**

* Following Ngiam Kong Seng, the main elements under the rule in Wilkinson v Downton are as follow:  
1. The defendant wilfully committed an act or did the act with malign intention (intend to cause harm)  
2. The act was calculated to cause physical harm / psychiatric harm to the plaintiff  
3. Physical, including psychiatric harm was in fact caused; and  
4. The harm was not too remote (consequences were within reasonable contemplation)

1) **Defendant wilfully committed an act**  
* Following James Rhodes v OPO, there needs to be an intention to cause severe distress, and the intention has to be actual and not merely imputed. The test is subjective.   
* (Recklessness will not suffice) Per Wright J in Wilkinson, recklessness would not suffice. In Wilkinson, the defendant played a practical joke on the plaintiff by telling her that her husband had met with a serious accident. The court found that this was done wilfully. Similarly, \<Defendant\> did the \<act\> to \<obtain something / analogise from facts\>. This suggests that the defendant committed the \<act\> purposefully and was not reckless. Therefore, this evinced malign intention and wilful conduct.   
* (Lying to obtain information) In Javier v Sweeney, the defendant lied to the plaintiff that her fiancé was a German spy. This was so as to obtain certain information about her employer. The court held that this constituted malign intention. Similarly, \<Defendant\> did the \<act\> to \<obtain something / analogise from facts\>. This evinced malign intention and wilful conduct.   
* (Act in good faith) In Wainwright v Home Office, the court held that there was no finding that the prison officers intended to cause distress to the plaintiffs. This was because they had acted in good faith. Furthermore, the deviations from procedure for the strip-searches were merely the result of sloppiness, as opposed to an intention to increase humiliation Similarly, \<Defendant\> acted in good faith. He did not intend to \<cause whatever harm\> to the \<Plaintiff\>. As such, there is no maligned intention on the part of the \<Defendant\>. 

| Analysis if got time Per James Rhodes v OPO, it allows liability to arise for the \<defendant\> where there is an absence of the requisite mens rea.  It would be unjust and disproportionate to hold \<defendant\> liable for an outcome he did not intend. It is submitted that a high threshold should be affirmed in Singapore. This is because it would distinguish between victims in accordance to their degree of culpability. Further, a lower degree of fault could still be punishable under the POHA, which has considerable overlap with the rule in Wilkinson. |

2) **The act was calculated to cause physical harm**  
* Second, \<Df’s\> act was likely to cause physical harm to \<Plaintiff\> as \<reasons\>. \<Defendant\> \<disseminated information / committed act\> knowing that it was likely to cause physical harm to \<Plaintiff\>. The second element is likely satisfied.

3) **Physical, including psychiatric harm was in fact caused**  
* (Recognised psychiatric illness is required) Following Ngiam Kong Seng, physical harm or recognized psychiatric illness is required. \<Plaintiff\> indeed suffered from \<physical harm / psychiatric illness\>. \<Plaintiff\>’s psychiatric illness of \<insert illness\> was also medically certified by \<medical doctor / opinion\>.   
* (If applicable) However, the difficulty of obtaining accurate information of psychiatric harm should be recognized as such cases are diagnosed only by symptoms found simply based on conversation between the patient and the doctor. Most of the time, tangible physical information is not available or used in diagnosis. Thus, it could be difficult to tell whether \<Plaintiff\>’s claims are genuine.   
* (Emotional distress insufficient, must have recognised psych illness) Following Wainwright v Home Office, though \<Plaintiff\> suffered from mental / emotional distress of \<insert facts to show that plaintiff suffered emotional distress\>, this is insufficient to fulfil this limb as mere distress is not actionable. It does not constitute a recognized psychiatric illness. Thus, \<Plaintiff\> is unlikely to succeed under this limb. 

4) **The harm was not too remote**  
* The harm caused, or effect produced to \<cause harm to Plaintiff\> would have been within the contemplation of a reasonable person in the shoes of the \<Defendant\>. Further, the connection between the cause, \<Defendant’s act\> and effect is sufficiently close and complete. Thus, the fourth element is likely fulfilled. 

5) **Concluding statement for rule in Wilkinson v Downton rule**  
* With all the elements satisfied, \<Plaintiff\> can bring an action against \<Defendant\> under the rule in Wilkinson v Downton.


## **Harassment**

### 

1. ### **Section 3 (Intentionally causing harassment, alarm or distress)**

| Under s11 of the POHA, \<Plaintiff\> may bring civil proceedings in a court against \<Defendant\> for breaching s3 of the POHA.  |  |  |

Presently, the statute does not provide a definition for harassment, alarm or distress, however, the courts in Malcomson v Mehta prior to the enactment of POHA shed light on what could constitute “harassment, alarm and distress”. On the facts of Malcomson, this was described as one embarking on a course of action persistently to make the life of the plaintiff unbearable such as to wear him or  her out and in the process causing them “much annoyance and distress”. (If it involves online harassment) As evinced from Malcomson, with the internet, technology, urbanisation and the increase in leisure time, people  have been getting more creative and intense in the ways that they harass someone.

This  constituted the tort of nuisance. However this poses a  conceptual difficulty since the source of the emails/phone  calls or faxes since it is non-physical.
