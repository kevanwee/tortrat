SECTION 3 DUTY OF CARE: SPECIAL SITUATIONS

*A. Duty of care normally held to exist in straightforward cases involving physical damage to person or property*

20.3.1 A duty of care will normally be held to exist in straightforward cases involving physical damage to person or property: see, eg, *Tesa Tape Asia Pacific Pte Ltd v Wing Seng Logistics Pte Ltd \[2006\] 3 SLR (R) 116; \[2006\] SGHC 73* (*Tesa Tape*; see Section 20.4.2 below). However, in exceptional cases, where it would not be fair in the circumstances to impose a duty of care, the courts may hold there to be no duty even where physical damage is involved: *Marc Rich & Co v Bishop Rock Marine Co Ltd* \[1996\] 1 AC 211).

*B. Situations where courts do not recognise duty because of public policy reasons*

20.3.2 In less typical circumstances, the courts are often more circumspect. They have, at various times, and in various jurisdictions, refused – largely for reasons of public policy – to recognize the existence of a duty of care in a range of situations, such as:

* where moral issues are involved (eg, the cost of raising a healthy child following a failed sterilization, as in *McFarlane v Tayside Health Board* \[2000\] 2 AC 59, or the cost of raising a healthy child following a negligently-performed IVF procedure resulting in implantation of an embryo fertilized by the wrong sperm, as in ACB v Thomson Medical Pte Ltd and others \[2015\] SGHC 9, or where a disabled child claims his mother should have been advised to abort him, as in *Re JU \[2005\] 4 SLR (R) 96; \[2005\] SGHC 140* (see Section 20.4.10 below) and *Harriton v Stephens (2006) 226 ALR 391*) ;  
* where there is a conflict between negligence and other torts (eg, damage caused by a negligent act or statement which would be protected under the defence of qualified privilege in defamation – although note that no such conflict is held to arise in relation to employee-references: see Ramesh s/o Krishnan v AXA Life Insurance Singapore Pte Ltd \[2015\] SGHC 125\) ;  
* where it is considered necessary to accord immunity to certain classes of defendants (eg, damage caused as a result of judicial negligence).

20.3.3 In addition, there are a number of broad categories in which particular rules have been established to restrict the situations in which a duty is owed. These categories are examined below.

*C. Psychiatric harm: recovery possible when “three proximities” are fulfilled*

*Psychiatric Harm*

20.3.4 Historically, the courts were unwilling to allow recovery for negligently inflicted psychiatric illness. This unwillingness stemmed from an incomplete understanding of mental illness, and from fears that allowing recovery for mental, as opposed to physical, harm would give rise to fraudulent claims and lead to a potential flood of litigation.

20.3.5 The first cases to allow claims for psychiatric illness \- also known as claims for “nervous shock”, due to the requirement that the condition must be caused be a sudden shock to the system \- involved primary victims (i.e., those who feared for their own safety: *Dulieu v White* \[1901\] 2 KB 669). Technically, under current English law, a primary victim who suffers medically diagnosed psychiatric harm due to a defendant’s negligence need not even show that such damage was reasonably foreseeable, as long as some physical damage could reasonably have been foreseen: *Page v Smith* \[1995\] 2 All ER 736 (Page; see Section 20.6.5 below). However, Page has been the subject of considerable criticism and is regularly distinguished by the English courts: see, eg, *Rothwell v Chemical Engineering & Insulating Co Ltd & Anor* \[2007\] UKHL 39 (a case which also confirmed that risk and anxiety do not constitute actionable damage in negligence). Moreover, the Singapore Court of Appeal in *Ngiam Kong Seng & Anor \[2008\] 3 SLR (R) 674; \[2008\] SGCA 23* (*Ngaim; see Section 20.3.6 below) rejected Page, holding that even in primary victim cases medically diagnosed psychiatric harm must be foreseeable.*

20.3.6 Claims may also be brought by secondary victims (ie, those who have witnessed damage-causing events without themselves being in the sphere of physical danger). However, such claims succeed in more limited circumstances. In McLoughlin v O’Brian \[1983\] 1 AC 410 (McLoughlin), a case in which the House of Lords allowed a claim by a mother who saw the immediate aftermath of an accident involving her husband and children, Lord Wilberforce introduced the now famous requirement of the “three proximities.” Under the three proximities, secondary victims must have close ties of love and affection with the victims of physical harm and be able to establish that they suffered shock-induced psychiatric illness through witnessing the damage-causing events or their immediate aftermath with their own unaided senses. Although the decision in McLoughlin left open the precise range of situations in which such claims might be brought, its scope was subsequently narrowed by their Lordships in Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police \[1992\] 1 AC 310 (Alcock), a decision which, inter alia, restricted secondary victim claims to persons in a spousal or parent/child relationship (or, if specifically proved, a relationship of equivalent closeness) whose psychiatric illness was attributable to sudden shock. The strictness of Alcock has been mitigated elsewhere, particularly in Australia, which has abandoned both the sudden shock requirement (in Tame v New South Wales; Annetts v Australian Stations Pty Ltd \[2002\] HCA 35\) and the requirements of physical proximity and direct perception (in Gifford v Strang Patrick Stevedoring Pty Ltd \[2003\] HCA 33). Some Australian states even allow claims outside the spousal and parent/child categories. In addition, while most English decisions (such as Sion v Hampstead Health Authority \[1994\] 5 Med LR 170\) confirm a rigid application of the need for a secondary victim to be at the actual scene of an accident and to suffer sudden shock, some, like Galli-Atkinson v Seghal \[2003\] EWCA 697, where the physical proximity requirement was relaxed, seemed to point to a partial easing of Alcock, However, in Taylor v A Novo (UK) Ltd \[2013\] 3 WLR 989, the English Court of Appeal held, when refusing a woman’s claim for post-traumatic stress suffered after she witnessed her mother collapse and die following a workplace accident which had occurred three weeks previously, that any extension of the boundaries in secondary victim claims must be left to Parliament. In Singapore, a secondary victim’s claim for psychiatric harm without proof that the claimant had witnessed a sudden, shock-inducing event was allowed on special facts in the medical negligence case of *Pang Koi Fa v Lim Djoe Phing \[1993\] 2 SLR (R) 366; \[1993\] SGHC 153*. Following a detailed examination of the rules on psychiatric harm, the Court of Appeal in Ngiam (see Section 20.3.5 above), while recognizing arguments for comprehensive legislative reform, confirmed the applicability of the McLoughlin proximities in Singapore. In *Man Mohan Singh & Anor v Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd (now known as QBE Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd & Anor & Anor appeal \[2008\] 3 SLR (R) 735; \[2008\] SGCA 24* (Man Mohan Singh; see Section 20.6.3 below), decided just after Ngiam, the McLoughlin proximities were applied in refusing a claim by parents who had neither been at the scene of the accident in which their children were fatally injured nor had witnessed the immediate aftermath, and whose action had not been definitively shown to relate to psychiatric harm rather than pathological grief.

*D. Pure economic loss not linked to physical damage*

20.3.7 The courts have always allowed recovery for economic loss which flows from physical damage: Spartan Steel and Alloys Ltd v Martin & Co \[1972\] QB 27\.

20.3.8 It was, however, historically impossible to recover for ‘pure’ economic loss – ie, loss which could not be linked to physical damage. The refusal to allow such claims was attributable to a number of concerns, the most significant of which was the perceived danger of a possible flood of litigation due to the knock-on effect of economic damage.

*Statements*

*(1) Negligent statements: recovery possible when there is voluntary assumption of responsibility and reasonable reliance*

20.3.9 In Hedley Byrne & Co v Heller & Partners Ltd \[1964\] AC 465 (Hedley Byrne) the House of Lords first recognized the possibility of recovering for pure economic loss caused by negligent statements. The Hedley Byrne principle, based on reasonable reliance by a claimant in circumstances where a defendant voluntarily assumes responsibility for his statement, has since been applied in numerous cases in all major jurisdictions. The decision by the House of Lords in Caparo (see Section 20.2.6 above), which confined the principle to situations where the statement was given by the maker to a known recipient for a specific purpose of which the maker was aware, led for some years to a more cautious approach to imposing liability for negligent misstatements, particularly with respect to the liability of auditors when preparing company accounts: see, eg, *Ikumene Singapore Pte Ltd & Anor v Leong Chee Leng \[1993\] 2 SLR (R) 480; \[1993\] SGCA 50* and *Public Prosecutor v Tan Cheng Yew and another appeal \[2013\] 1 SLR 1095*Standard Chartered Bank & Anor v Coopers & Lybrand \[1993\] 3 SLR (R) 712\. However, in recent years the courts have shown a renewed willingness to allow claims for negligent misstatements: see, eg, Law Society v KPMG Peat Marwick \[2004\] 4 All ER 540\. For an application of Hedley Byrne in the context of an architect’s duty to advise of the risks inherent in a building contract, see *Sonny Yap Boon Keng v Pacific Prince International Pte Ltd & Anor \[2009\] 1 SLR (R) 385; \[2008\] SGHC 161*. Note that the courts remain cautious about allowing claims in negligence where the relationship is governed by contract – although in *Go Dante Yap v Bank Austria Creditanstalt AG \[2011\] 4 SLR 559; \[2011\] SGCA 39* (Go Dante Yap; see Section 20.3.13 below), the Court of Appeal recognised both an implied contractual duty of care on the part of a bank in carrying out its client’s instructions, as well as a duty of care in negligence to give advice of a kind which could reasonably have been expected of it when providing the client with financial services. (On the facts, however, there was no breach of either the contractual or the tortious duty).

*Professional Responsibility*

*(2) Professional responsibility: recovery possible for negligent performance*

20.3.10 The Hedley Byrne principle has also been extended in most jurisdictions to cover professional responsibility (eg, the negligent drafting or execution of wills and other documents by solicitors: White v Jones \[1995\] 2 AC 207; AEL and Ors v Cheo Yeoh & Associates LLC & Anor \[2014\] SGHC 129). In such situations, a duty of care is held to exist even when the negligence complained of takes the form of an act rather than a statement, and even in the absence of active reliance by the claimant. For a decision of the Court of Appeal finding that a solicitor who negligently caused loss to non-contracting parties owed those parties a duty of care, see Anwar Patrick Adrian (Section 20.2.13 above). With respect to the overlap between professional responsibility and negligent statements, see too *Plan Assure PA (formerly known as Patrick Lee PAC) v Gaelic Inns Pte Ltd \[2007\] 4 SLR (R) 513; \[2007\] SGCA 41*, and for further discussion of the liability of professionals, see Section 20.4.6 below.

*Acts*

*(3) Negligent acts causing pure economic loss: recoverable under the Spandeck test*

20.3.11 The position with respect to negligent acts which cause pure economic loss varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In Singapore, Australia and other jurisdictions, it is – in some circumstances – possible to sue for pure economic loss caused by negligent acts. However, English law still takes an extremely restrictive approach to such claims.

20.3.12 In Singapore, the Court of Appeal has imposed a duty of care for pure economic loss in actions brought by management corporations for the negligent design and defective construction of condominiums in Ocean Front (see Section 20.2.9 above) and *RSP Architects v MCST Plan No 1075 (Eastern Lagoon) \[1999\] 2 SLR (R) 134*. The position in Singapore is similar to that in Bryan v Maloney (1995) 182 CLR 609, where the Australian High Court, in a decision based largely on the economic vulnerability of individuals when purchasing their homes, imposed on the builder of a house a duty of care towards a subsequent purchaser. (Indeed, the decision of the High Court of Singapore in *Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 2757 v Lee Mow Woo \[2011\] SGHC 112* suggests that the courts in Singapore might even be willing to extend this principle to commercial properties. If this is in fact the case, it will be consistent with the decision of the Supreme Court of New Zealand in Body Corporate 207624 v North Shore City Council \[2012\] NZSC 83, but not that of the High Court of Australia in Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd (2004) 216 CLR 515.) The House of Lords, on the other hand, unequivocally rejected the possibility of recovering for pure economic loss associated with any category of defective premises in Murphy v Brentwood District Council \[1991\] AC 398 (which overruled Anns on the economic loss point), and the English courts have shown no sign of relaxing this attitude.

*(4) More restrictive approach adopted when imposing a duty of care for pure economic loss in comparison to that applied in cases of physical damage*

20.3.13 In P T Bumi (see Section 20.2.10 above), a case which involved an unsuccessful claim for a defective chattel, the Singapore Court of Appeal expressed the need for extreme caution in allowing claims outside the arena of actions by management corporations with respect to residential property, particularly where the circumstances were fundamentally contractual. In *United Project Consultants Pte Ltd v Leong Kwok Onn \[2005\] 4 SLR (R) 214* (United Project Consultants; see Section 20.7.3 below) the Court of Appeal confirmed that in deciding whether to impose a duty of care for pure economic loss the courts would adopt a more restrictive approach than that applied in cases of physical damage, and a similarly cautious approach prevailed in the Court of Appeal in Sunny Metal (see Sections 20.2.12 above and 20.5.1 and 20.5.2 below), a contractual matrix case which raised issues of both tort and contract. In Spandeck (see Section 20.2.13 above), the Court of Appeal held that the same two-stage test of proximity – based on assumption of responsibility and reliance – and policy should be used with respect to all categories of claim. However, it recognised that a more restrictive application might be appropriate in cases of economic loss, and held that the action in that case, which again involved a contractual matrix, must fail. The existence of a contractual matrix will not, however, necessarily prove fatal to an action in negligence. In Animal Concerns (see Section 20.2.13 above) the Court of Appeal held that both assumption of responsibility and reliance were satisfied in an action brought by the claimant, which had commissioned a construction project, against the project’s clerk of works – notwithstanding the existence of a contract between the claimant and the project’s contractor. Similarly, in Go Dante Yap (see Section 20.3.9 above), it was held that, in addition to an implied contractual duty, a bank owed its client a duty of care in negligence when providing financial services (although neither duty was breached on the facts). For an economic loss case involving different issues, see Kimly (Section 20.2.13 above) in which the Court of Appeal held that a certifying engineer ought not to have to act as insurer for a contractor’s statutory obligations to ensure worker safety.

20.3.14 Where a claimant suffers pure economic loss through damage not to his own property but to property belonging to someone else, actions have been allowed in Australia, again based on the specific economic vulnerability to which the defendant’s negligence has exposed the claimant: Perre & ors v Apand Pty Ltd (1999) 198 CLR 180\. However, English law does not allow such actions in any circumstances: Candlewood Navigation v Mitsui OSK Lines \[1986\] AC 1\.

*C. No general duty for pure omissions*

*(1) Reasons for not imposing duty with respect to pure omissions*

20.3.15 Generally, no duty is imposed with respect to pure omissions – ie, situations in which a defendant who has created no danger to the claimant merely fails to prevent him from sustaining harm. There are a number of reasons for this. One is the large number of potential defendants in situations of failure to act. Another is society’s focus on the more modest aim of discouraging wrongdoing rather than on the more ambitious one of encouraging good deeds. For these and other reasons, there is, for example, ordinarily no duty to rescue – even when such an act could be carried out without personal risk.

*(2) Situations where there is a duty to act to prevent harm*

20.3.16 However, there will be a duty to act to prevent harm in certain situations, eg:

* where the defendant and the claimant are in a special relationship of dependence (such as guardian/child, carrier/passenger, employer/employee) ;  
* where the defendant has control over something which, or someone who, poses a threat to the claimant (in which respect, note that the responsibility of an occupier of premises to persons entering those premises – which was formerly determined by the application of special rules relating to occupiers’ liability – is now broadly governed by the Spandeck test for duty of care: *Toh Siew Kee v Ho Ah Lam Ferrocement (Pte) Ltd \[2013\] SGCA 29\)* ; or  
* where the defendant has assumed responsibility for the claimant or his property.

*F. Statutory authorities owe a duty only in restricted circumstances*

*(1) Duty of care unlikely to arise where conduct involves policy, discretionary elements or the balancing of resources*

20.3.17 A statutory authority owes a duty of care to members of the public for a failure to exercise its statutory powers – or for the improper exercise of those powers – only in restricted circumstances. This is because statutory authorities invariably have limited resources and are unlikely when allocating those resources to be able to act in a way which satisfies all those affected by their decisions. The courts, faced with turning what is effectively a public duty in to a private one, have attempted to delimit the duty of care in negligence by developing various tests. These tests include the operational/policy test (Anns, see Section 20.2.4 to 20.2.5 above), the ‘irrationality’ test (Stovin v Wise \[1996\] AC 293), and the ‘justiciability’ test (Barrett v Enfield London Borough Council \[1999\] 3 WLR 628). It is generally more likely that an act rather than an omission will be regarded as justiciable, and it is unlikely that conduct which involves policy or discretionary elements or the balancing of resources or competing functions will be held to give rise to a duty of care.

*(2) Developments in the United Kingdom*

20.3.18 For several years, the UK courts were extremely cautious in their attitude to claims against statutory authorities: X (Minors) v Bedfordshire County Council \[1995\] 2 AC 633\. However, later cases suggest a slight relaxation in this respect, particularly where there is a direct relationship between the statutory authority and the claimant: Phelps v Hillingdon London Borough Council \[2001\] 2 AC 619\. In Singapore, observations by the Court of Appeal in Andrea De Cruz (see Section 20.2.10 above and 20.5.13 below) indicate the possibility of regulatory bodies being held responsible for the negligent ‘rubber stamping’ of commercial products.

20.3.19 A number of cases relate to the duty owed by the emergency services in the exercise of their statutory functions. The majority of these cases concern the police, whose duty to protect the public at large does not extend to a duty to protect individual members of the public during the conduct of an investigation: Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police \[1989\] AC 53, or even in response to an emergency call: Michael v Chief Constable of South Wales Police \[2015\] UKSC 2\. The rationale for this seemingly harsh approach is that a private law duty by the police to protect individuals from criminal acts committed by third parties would not only be difficult to confine within rational parameters, but would also be contrary to the ordinary principles of common law. The fire services owe no duty to individual members of the public either, even when they have undertaken to deal with a fire, unless they actually make matters worse through their positive intervention: Capital and Counties v Hampshire County Council \[1997\] QB 1004\. However, the ambulance services have been held to owe a duty of care to individual members of the public whom they have undertaken to assist: Kent v London Ambulance Services \[1999\] Lloyd’s Rep Med 58\.
