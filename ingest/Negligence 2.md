# **Duty of Care (Manufacturer’s liability):**

* Following Donoghue v Stevenson, manufacturers of consumer goods which:  
1)  are intended to reach the consumer without any reasonably available intermediate inspection; and  
2) who h	ave the knowledge that failure to take reasonable care would result in injury to the consumer care would result in injury to the consumer owes the consumer a duty to take reasonable care.  
* In TV Media Pte Ltd v De Cruz Andrea Heidi, the principle in Donoghue was extended to wholesaler/distributor who generally owe a duty to take reasonable care to consumers in the promotion, endorsement and advertising of pills. In the present case, \[defendant\] was also a \[manufacturer/distributor/wholesaler\] who sold \[goods\] that were intended to reach consumers without reasonable opportunities for inspection \[because they are sealed, etc.\]. \[defendant\] also knew that a failure to take reasonable care would result in injury, because \[reasons e.g. they are to be ingested and pose a real health risk\]. In this regard, the court will probably find that \[defendant\] owed \[plaintiff\] a duty of care.


# **Duty of Care (Occupiers’ liability; Injury occurs on property):**

1. ##  **To add to the front of the argument (Before covering Spandeck)**

* As held in See Toh Siew Kee, the law in Singapore on occupiers’ liability could and should be subsumed under the tort of negligence, with the overarching framework set out in Spandeck for the imposition of a duty of care in negligence claims being applied to determine whether an occupier owed a duty of care to an entrant to his premises.	

2. ## **General (After FF from earlier)** 

* The first stage of the Spandeck approach requires sufficient legal proximity between an entrant and an occupier so as to justify imposing a prima facie duty of care on the latter. Legal proximity embraces physical, circumstantial and causal proximity, and includes proximity arising from the voluntary assumption of responsibility and concomitant reliance. There is undoubtedly physical proximity between an occupier and an entrant merely by virtue of the fact that the entrant is physically situated on the occupier’s property. 

2. ##  **Proximity (Control and Lawfulness)**

* The next issue at hand involves control and lawfulness. In *See Toh Siew Kee*, the court held that when occupiers do not have effective control over their premises, this could negate a prima facie duty of care. In the case of See Toh Siew Kee, the premises were let to a third party. Therefore, the owners of the property had no material control over the premises.  
* \[Contrastingly/Similarly\], \<guilty party\> had \[significant/little\] control over the premises as \_\_\_ (no third party contractor, small area, machinery all connected to a machine under the guilty party’s direct control...)   
* (If no control) Therefore, a prima facie duty of care is not present.  
* (If have control) Having established that \<guilty party\> has significant control over the premises, the next issue involves lawfulness


3. ##  **Lawful Entrant?**

   \[Lawful\]  
* (Argue case facts first and why). Insofar as a lawful entrant is concerned, circumstantial proximity is “tautologically present” in the occupier-lawful entrant relationship because the hallmark of a lawful entrant’s presence on an occupier’s premises is the occupier’s consent to the lawful entrant’s presence. Thus, under the first stage of the Spandeck approach, the vast majority of occupiers having control of the property which they occupy and/or the activities carried out there de jure owe a prima facie duty of care to lawful entrants  
    
  \[Unlawful\]  
* (Argue case facts first and why), as such \<victim\> would be a residual entrant. the court will go on to consider “whether the particular facts of the case … justify imposing a prima facie duty of care” under the first stage of the Spandeck approach. That is to say, instead of considering only whether or not the occupier concerned had control over the property and/or the activities carried out there so as to justify the de jure imposition of a prima facie duty of care on him, the court will consider all the factors relevant to the first stage of the Spandeck approach.   
* *Return to Spandeck* 

# **Omissions to prevent 3rd party from causing harm:**

* Generally, the law does not impose liability for pure omissions. Such an imposition would restrict individual autonomy and would also give rise to the “why pick on me?” argument as enunciated in Stovin v Wise. This is because common law does not impose liability on pure omissions. However, in Smith v Littlewoods, Lord Goff laid down several exceptions to this general rule, under which a duty of care to prevent third parties from harming the plaintiff/plaintiff’s property may arise:

* As per Smith v Littlewoods, a defendant is not liable for the acts of a third party unless:  
1) There was a special relationship with the plaintiff because the defendant has assumed responsibility over the plaintiff to protect him from danger  
2) The defendant exercised control over the third party  
3) The defendant created the source of danger  
4) The defendant knew or ought to have known that the third party created the danger

| Where there is a special relationship based on an assumption of responsibility \*\*Note: Usually can use contractual r/s to prove  | \[tortfeasor\] was in a contractual relationship with \[plaintiff\]. Hence, \[tortfeasor\] had assumed responsibility to \[plaintiff\] to take reasonable care to \[do what\]. Therefore, given that \[plaintiff’s\] injury occurred due to \[tortfeasor’s reckless/careless omission of whatever he omitted to do\], proximity is established |
| :---- | :---- |
| Where there is a special relationship between the defendant and the third party based on control by the defendant  | Given that \<guilty party\> was a \<position of authority\>, it would mean that \<third party\> was directly under his supervision and control. Therefore, proximity is established.  |
| Where the defendant is responsible for creating a source of danger, which foreseeably, may be triggered by a third party, causing damage to the plaintiff  | In the present case, \[plaintiff\]’s injuries were also caused by \[defendant\]’s omission \[leaving something lying around, failing to secure something\] which he knew posed a risk because of \[circumstances\]. In this regard, the court will probably find that \[defendant\] owed \[plaintiff\] a duty of care.  |
| Where the defendant knows or ought to know that the third party has created a source of danger on the premises and he fails to take reasonable steps to prevent such danger from damaging neighbouring property  | In Smith v Littlewoods, the defendant was unaware of the vandals’ previous attempts to break into the cinema and set it on fire. Thus, the court held that for a reasonable person in the position of the defendants, it would not have been reasonably foreseeable that a probable consequence of the cinema being vacated with no steps being taken to maintain it lockfast, would be that it would be set on fire with consequent risk of damage to neighbouring properties. Similarly, given that \[tortfeasor\] was unaware of the \[source of danger\] created by \[third party\], the \[damage to the plaintiff/property\] would not have been reasonably foreseeable. Thus, the \[tortfeasor\] does not owe the \[plaintiff\] a duty of care.  |

# **Duty of Care (Special type of harm \- “pure” economic loss):**

Note: Central concept is VAR/RR  
GO INTO SPANDECK FF FIRST\!\!

1. ## **PEL Recoverable?**

* Following Spartan Steel v Martin, loss consequential upon physical damage is recoverable but pure economic loss is unrecoverable due to concerns of indeterminate liability. However, in the SGCA decision of NTUC Foodfare v SIA Engineering, the court clarified that there was no general rule excluding recovery of pure economic loss if it could be shown that, in all the circumstances, the parties were in a proximate relationship and the concern over the ensuing potential indeterminate liability could be adequately addressed.  
* To this end, the parties (airtug operator and food kiosk operator) were sufficiently proximate because –  
  * Physical proximity: Airtug operator operated in close propinquity to kiosk  
  * Causal proximity between operator’s negligence in driving airtug and loss of profits sustained by NTUC over the period of the Closure Order  
  * \*\*Knowledge: Operator would have known that negligent operation of the Airtug in the UBHA carried the risk of causing a determinate class of persons, the occupiers of the Lounge, to suffer a specific kind of loss, economic loss flowing directly from their inability to use their premises

\*\*Note: Knowledge factor is important in cases where liability to an indeterminate class is a concern

2. ## **Proximity**

* In this situation, as it involves a case of “pure” economic loss since it is neither a physical damage or consequential upon any form of physical damage. In Spartan Steel, casual proximity is a key consideration for the court to decide on whether to impose a duty of care.  
    
* The law is more restrictive in finding a prima facie duty of care in cases involving “pure” economic losses as compared to those involving physical and property damage compared to Manufacturer’s liability causing physical injury or property damage (*The Sunrise Crane*).   
* There is often a need to refute the negative public policy consideration of indeterminate liability and that establishing a DOC would not undermine parties’ contractual agreements (*NTUC Foodfare v SIA Engineering*). 

* (Don’t use unless structural defect) In cases of structural defects, it would lead to indeterminate liability because developer would not know who would eventually own the house and there would be an indefinitely transmissible warranty of construction quality to multiple subsequent purchasers (*Ocean Front*)

# **Duty of Care (Special type of harm \- “pure” economic loss \+ misstatements):**

Since this is a case involving a negligent misstatement which resulted in pure economic loss, the factors of greater relevance are the twin criterion of voluntary assumption of liability and reliance per Hedley Byrne. Extra emphasis will be placed on these requirements in the analysis.

1. ## **Defining what PEL is**

* What is PEL \- In spartan steel, a steel mill’s power supply was cut off when the defendant negligently cut electrical cables nearby. The steel in the furnace was ruined as a result. Court distinguished between physical damage to property, consequential economic loss, and PEL.   
* Physical loss: Loss of materials used to process that particular batch of steel \- recoverable Consequential economic loss: loss of profits on that batch of steel \- recoverable   
* PEL: loss of profits for subsequent batches of steel which might have been produced if electricity had not been halted \- not recoverable   
    
  \[Approach to PEL in SG\]  
* While the courts tend to be more reluctant to award damages for PEL, the court in *ACB v Thomson* held that there is no general exclusionary rule against recovery for PEL.  
* PEL: financial damage suffered as a result of the negligent act of another party which is not accompanied by/ consequential on any physical damage to a person or property.

2. ## **“Proximity”**

* Taking reference to *Hedley Byrne,* the following factors may be identified from Hedley Byrne in determining whether a duty of care would arise between the plaintiff and the defendant:  
1) the skill and judgement of the maker of the statement;  
2) whether the maker knows or ought to know that the other person will rely on the statement; and  
3) whether the maker of the statement voluntarily undertakes or assumes responsibility for making the statement.	  
* (Contractual relation) Furthermore, where the relationship between the maker of the statement and the recipient is akin to contract (such as the solicitor client and the banker-customer relationships), a duty of care is likely to arise. In such a case, the proximity requirement is satisfied.  
* With respect to (a), the plaintiff is required to show that the defendant had either carried on the business of giving advice of the nature sought by the plaintiff or had held out to possess the necessary skill and competence to give such advice.  
* (Analogise with the case facts)

1) **Skill and judgement**  
* Following Hedley Byrne, if the defendant:  
1) Continued giving advice of the nature sought by the plaintiff; or  
2) Held out to possess the necessary skill and competence to give out such advice  
* First, \<guilty party\>’s skill and judgement was that of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ as evinced by \_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

| Continued giving advice | Held out to possess skill and competence |
| :---- | :---- |
| Currently, after \<guilty party\> made the initial statement, he carried on giving advice as seen in \_\_\_\_\_\_. Therefore, the first factor is present | Currently, \<guilty party\> held himself out to be \<position of expertise\> as seen in \_\_\_\_\_\_ (telling innocent party that he is a professional....) Therefore, the first factor is present |

* The above requirements of purpose, knowledge and reliance constitute the ingredients of "proximity" within the Caparo three-part test.	

2) **Reliance (Knowledge of such reliance)**  
* Before determining whether \<guilty party\> knows or ought to know that \<innocent party\> would rely on the statement, reliance needs to be established first. Therefore, we will examine the context in which the statement was given.

| Casual Context; | Customer’s knowledge of risk \+ No Advisory Relationship; reliance absent | Business context; reliance present  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Normally on social and casual occasions, reliance would be absent Similarly, given that \<guilty party\> made the statement during a casual occasion, it is unlikely that \<innocent party\> relied on the statement  Attempting to establish reliance: Although the statement was given in a casual situation, that \<innocent party\> had taken the statement seriously. This is seen where \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (actively listening, immediately makes decision after hearing statement) Following Hedley Byrne, a duty of care may still arise outside of contractual and fiduciary relationships. Hence, simply being in a causal setting does not preclude the existence of reliance.  | In Deutsche Bank AG, the court held that where the customer knows of the risks, and there is no Advisory relationship, it is less likely to find reliance Similarly, \<innocent party\> would know the risks apparent. This is because \_\_\_\_\_ (experienced business person, prior dealings ......) Therefore, reliance is absent  | Following Lord Reid in Hedley Byrne and Fish v Kelly, it is held that such a statement must be made in a business or professional context for a duty of care to arise. Similarly, given that \<guilty party\> made the statement during a business occasion, it is likely that \<innocent party\> relied on the statement Payment for statement Following Lord Delvin in Hedley Byrne, where payment is made for information/ advice, it would serve as evidence that the advice is being relied upon and that the adviser knows of it.  |


* In terms of knowledge, this is evident/not evident given that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (guilty party clearly sees innocent party agreeing, following the exact instructions, constantly asking for advice.....) Therefore, knowledge is present.  
* Hence, the second factor relating to reliance has been established  
    
3) **Assumption of Responsibility**  
* Lastly, it must be determined whether \<guilty party\> assumed responsibility


| Assumption Present | Assumption Absent |
| :---- | :---- |
| Contractual Duty In Henderson v Merrett, if there is a contractual duty between the defendant and plaintiff where the former manages the latter, there is an assumption of responsibility. This is because they hold themselves as possessing special expertise to give advice. Defendant gives advice In Deutsche Bank AG v Chang Tse Wen, it was held that there would be voluntary assumption of responsibility if a person gives financial or investment advice to another who then relies upon that advice, it may ordinarily be concluded that an advisory relationship has arisen between them, leading to an assumption of responsibility.  Although on appeal the CA noted that assumption was absent, this was because there was no evidence that such advice was given during the contract Gratuitous Advice (VERY RARE, BE CAREFUL) (+) Although the advice was given gratuitously, following Hedley Byrne, there can be a VAR even if the service is provided gratuitously, if it is known that the other party will rely on the advice. Presently, although \<defendant\> had given the advice gratuitously, he knew that \<plaintiff\> would rely upon it. Therefore, VAR.  Defendant provided and offered facilities  In Go Dante Yap, there was a VAR as the respondent, in offering private banking and wealth-management facilities, held itself out as possessing special skill or expertise, thus, there was an assumption of responsibility on the part of the bank.  Similarly, \<guilty party\> had \<either of the two\>. Therefore, assumption of responsibility is present  | Disclaimer In Hedley Byrne, the disclaimer was given before the assumption of responsibility, therefore relinquishing the VAR. Presently, the disclaimer was **given before the advice** was made therefore, it would not be given effect. Hence, assumption of responsibility is absent Execution account in absence of advise Following Deutsche Bank AG, where a bank only executes transactions in the absence of advice, there is no assumption.  |

* Proximity renders liability determinate \- one must be “close enough” to be owed a duty
