# **Duty of Care (Special type of harm \- Contractual Relations):**

## **Contracts affirming a duty of care**

* \[Proto-contractual framework\]  
* The Spandeck framework is still the universal test. It is not required for VAR/R to be proven in every case within a proto-contractual framework (*Anwar Patrick Adrian*).  
* (+) Animal Concerns v Tan Boon Kwee: The existence of a contractual relationship outside of the Pf and Df does not negate the possibility of a proto-contractual framework under Hedley Byrne principles. While a contract between the contractor and the Pf existed, VAR+R was still satisfied for the Df to owe a duty of care as he was the director of the contractor and had appointed himself the clerk of works.

* \[Implied contractual duty of skill and care\]  
* In Go Dante Yap, the contractual duty of skill and care implied in law exists in a contract under which a skilled or professional person agrees to render certain services to his client in return for a specified or reasonable fee. This is evidence of a voluntary assumption of responsibility to avoid detriment to the Pf under Hedley Byrne principles.

# **Duty of Care (Public Policy Considerations):**

* Finally, are there public policy considerations to negate a *prima facie* duty of care under the second stage of the Spandeck framework? 

* In *ACB v Thomson Medical Pte Ltd* and others, matters are considered as public policy consider considerations of “public morality, social philosophy, and economics” and “the focus at this stage is on broader societal considerations rather than matters which bear only on the interests of the parties inter se and the question is whether there are concerns of community welfare”. 

* (If nothing) Therefore, given that there are no policy considerations negating a duty of care, a duty of care is owed by \<guilty party\>

| Floodgates of litigation and indeterminate liability | In the present case, allowing the claims of \[claim for damage \+ how that damage was caused\] would open the floodgates for an indeterminacy of other claims. \[to explain why, think about the possible context in which there would be indeterminate liability\] |
| :---- | :---- |
| Imposing liability may place unwanted financial pressure and lead to defensive action. In addition, the courts are not well-placed to judge policy and there is an undesirability of having the public bodies to defend lawsuits |  |
| One policy consideration is the objectives of public good and social utility. | If a duty of care were to be imposed on, then the benefit to society \[arising from the defendant’s work and functions as a person who carries out non-profit work or functions for public benefit\] may be curtailed.  |
| Party autonomy to contract | In NTUC Foodfare v SIA, for policy considerations, the court factors in the availability of insurance and whether or not recognising a duty of care would undermine the parties contractual arrangement  |
