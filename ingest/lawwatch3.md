SECTION 4 BREACH OF DUTY

20.4.1 Before a court can determine whether the defendant has breached his duty to the claimant, it is first necessary to establish the standard of care to which he will be held.

*The Standard of Care*

*A. Establishing the due standard of care: whether reasonable care has been taken to avoid reasonably foreseeable harm*

20.4.2 The basic question in every case is whether reasonable care has been taken to avoid reasonably foreseeable harm: Government of Malaysia v Jumal b Mahmud \[1977\] 2 MLJ 103\. Factors which are relevant in this determination include:

* the likelihood or probability of the risk eventuating;  
* the seriousness or gravity of the foreseeable risk;  
* the practicability of avoiding or minimising the risk;  
* the justifiability of taking the risk;  
* the time for assessing the risk;  
* the relevant characteristics of the foreseeable plaintiff

For an application of these factors, see the judgement of Choo Han Teck J in Tesa Tape (see Section 20.3.1 above). The test used is that of the reasonable person in the circumstances. It is an objective test, under which a defendant is judged not by his own characteristics and attributes but by the nature of the task he is performing and the circumstances in which he is performing it. For a clear illustration of the balancing of factors – including the magnitude of the risk inherent in an activity, the social utility of that activity, the seriousness of the harm should the risk eventuate, and the cost of taking precautions against the risk, see too the judgment of *Coomaraswamy J in BNJ v SMRT Trains Ltd and another \[2014\] 2 SLR 7; \[2013\] SGHC 286* (BNJ; see too Section 20.4.13 below).

20.4.3 Note that in certain areas – such as industrial safety – there is considerable interplay between duty and standard of care. For a Court of Appeal decision recognising the extensive, non-delegable, nature of an employer’s obligations to its employees, and the standard of care to which the employer will consequently be held, see *Chandran a/l Subbiah v Dockers Marine Pte Ltd \[2010\] 1 SLR 786; \[2009\] SGCA 58*. Although the standard of care applicable to independent contractors is less onerous than that for employees, in appropriate cases employers are held accountable: see, eg, *Arnold William v Tanoto Shipyard Pte Ltd \[2016\] SGHC 89* (where on appeal the lower court’s finding that an independent contractor had been 50% contributorily negligent was overturned, and the employer was held fully liable). For confirmation that industry standards should be taken into account in assessing the standard of care, see too *Jurong Primewide Pte Ltd v Moh Seng Cranes Pte Ltd and others \[2014\] SGCA 6*.

*B. Special standards of care*

*(1) Standard of care not normally lowered to take account of a defendant’s inexperience*

20.4.4 The standard of care is not normally lowered to take account of a defendant’s inexperience, since that would be unfair to those whom he injures: Nettleship v Weston \[1971\] 2 QB 581\. For much the same reason, an amateur is judged according to objective standards of acceptability for the task in which he is engaged, not according to his personal level of expertise.

*(2) Lower standard applied to children*

20.4.5 A lower standard is applied to children: Mullin v Richards \[1998\] 1 WLR 1304 and, it seems, to conduct in the heat of competition during sporting events: Wooldridge v Sumner \[1963\] 2 QB 43 (see too Section 20.7.8 below). A higher standard is applicable where the defendant knows or can foresee that a claimant is particularly vulnerable: Paris v Stepney Borough Council \[1951\] AC 367\.

*(3) Professional negligence: standard of care is that of “the ordinary skilled man exercising and professing to have that special skill”*

20.4.6 The duty owed by professionals extends equally to acts and statements and is nowadays encompassed by the notion of ‘professional responsibility’ (see Section 20.3.10 above). The applicable standard of care, as laid down by McNair J. in Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee \[1957\] 1 WLR 582 (Bolam) at 586, is that of “the ordinary skilled man exercising and professing to have that special skill.” Under the Bolam test, a professional will not be negligent as long as he meets the standard of an ordinary competent exponent of his profession. (For an application of the Bolam test with respect to auditors, see *JSI Shipping (S) Pte Ltd v Teofoongwonglcloong (A Firm) \[2007\] 4 SLR (R) 460; \[2007\] SGCA 40* (JSI Shipping; see Sections 20.4.8 and 20.4.10 below)).

20.4.7 In the conduct of trades and professions, the law allows for a variety of levels of qualification, and thus a variety of standards, as long as the level of expertise which can be expected from any given professional is readily apparent from his particular qualification (eg, that he is a general practitioner rather than a specialist). However, every professional must achieve an acceptable level of basic competence: Ang Tiong Seng v Goh Huan Chir \[1970\] 2 MLJ 271\.

20.4.8 When assessing whether or not a professional has been negligent, the courts will normally use as their benchmark the common practice within the relevant profession. However, where they consider that a profession adopts an unjustifiably lax practice, they may condemn the common standard as negligent: Edward Wong Finance Co Ltd v Johnson, Stokes and Master \[1984\] AC 296 and JSI Shipping (see Sections 20.4.6 above and 20.4.10 below).

*Medical Negligence*

*(4) Medical negligence: different applications of the Bolam test in various jurisdictions*

20.4.9 In his decision in Bolam (see Section 20.4.6 above) McNair J. laid down a specific test for determining the standard of care applicable to the medical profession. Under this test, a doctor “is not guilty of negligence if he has acted in accordance with a practice accepted as proper by a responsible body of medical men skilled in that particular art.”

20.4.10 The Bolam test forms the basis for assessing medical negligence in Singapore and in the UK, although in the latter its application is now confined to negligent treatment and diagnosis (see Section 20.4.11 below). Even though the court reserves the right to find a doctor negligent if he fails to meet a threshold test of logic and consistency (Bolitho v City and Hackney Health Authority \[1998\] AC 232), the significance which the courts place on the opinions of fellow doctors when determining the issue of negligence tends – particularly in Singapore – to make it more difficult for claimants to succeed in medical actions than might be the case in actions against other professions: *Dr Khoo James and anor v Gunapathy d/o Muniandy \[2002\] 2 SLR 414*. For an application of Gunapathy, see Re JU (Section 20.3.2 above), a decision which also raises issues relating to the difficult and somewhat controversial areas of wrongful life and wrongful birth. (Note, however, that the decision of the Court of Appeal in JSI Shipping (see Sections 20.4.6 and 20.4.8 above) *could* be interpreted as favouring a common professional standard.)

20.4.11 In Rogers v Whitaker (1992) 175 CLR 479, which concerned failure to disclose a risk involved in medical treatment, the Bolam test was rejected in Australia in favour of a test based on the duty to disclose a risk which a reasonable patient would consider material. This followed the approach already adopted in Canada under Reibl v Hughes (1980) 114 DLR (3d). Although under the decision in Sidaway v Bethlem Royal Hospital \[1985\] AC 871 (Sidaway) the English courts traditionally applied the Bolam test to cases of negligent non-disclosure of risks, the decision of the House of Lords in Chester v Afshar \[2004\] UKHL 41 (Chester; see Section 20.5.11 below), while focusing primarily on the issue of causation, effectively favoured a reasonable patient approach to failure to disclose a risk of treatment. Application of the reasonable patient approach in the UK has now been confirmed by the Supreme Court in Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board \[2015\] UKSC 11 (Montgomery), which overruled Sidaway and held that a doctor must disclose risks which a reasonable person in the position of the patient would consider to be material. Interestingly, although in most jurisdictions the rejection of the Bolam test has been largely confined to cases involving non-disclosure of medical risks, the Federal Court of Malaysia implied in Foo Fia Na v Dr Soo Fook Mun \[2007\] 1 MLJ 593 that the reasonable patient test should be used in Malaysia to assess *all* forms of medical negligence (although the decision itself related only to the disclosure of risks). In Singapore, however, the High Court has continued to treat itself bound under Gunapathy (see Section 20.4.10 above) to apply the Bolam/Bolitho approach not only to negligent diagnosis and treatment, but also to negligent non-disclosure of risks: see, eg, *Hii Chii Kok v Ooi Peng Jin London Lucien and another \[2016\] SGHC 21* (in which, however, it was held that even under the Montgomery approach the action would have failed).

*Proof of Breach*

*C. Proving breach of duty is a question of fact determined by specific circumstances of each case*

20.4.12 Whether or not a duty has been breached is a question of fact to be determined according to the specific circumstances of each case. For this reason, precedents are of value only in terms of the general principles which they establish: Qualcast (Wolverhampton) Ltd v Haynes \[1959\] AC 743\.

*(1) Shifting of burden to the defendant: where exact cause of incident is unknown, defendant had control over the agent of harm, and that relevant damage would not normally have occurred in the absence of negligence*

20.4.13 In some circumstances, the claimant may lack sufficient knowledge to prove negligence on the part of the defendant. In such circumstances, the defendant will clearly choose to remain silent unless the normal rules for establishing negligence are varied. The courts will vary the rules and infer negligence if the claimant can show that the exact cause of the incident is unknown, that the defendant had control over the agent of harm, and that the relevant damage would not normally have occurred in the absence of negligence. On occasion the effect of this inference (sometimes referred to under the Latin maxim res ipsa loquitur) has been to shift the legal burden of proof onto the defendant, but it more frequently results only in the evidentiary burden being shifted. This requires the defendant to adduce evidence in rebuttal, failing which the claimant’s case will succeed: *Awang b Dollah v Shun Shing Construction \[1996\] SGHC 296*. Note, however, that in BNJ (see section 20.4.2 above) the High Court of Singapore confirmed that res ipsa loquitur will not apply where the circumstances are clear and there is no evidentiary gap.
